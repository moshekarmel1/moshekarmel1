### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing Mortgage software into the modern era.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all kinds of stuff. Some specific things: Vector Databases & LLM's.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how awesome Javascript is.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just holler or find me on LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do much on public Github because I don't get paid for it.
