### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing Mortgage software into the modern era.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all kinds of stuff. Some specific things: Graph Databases, DNS + Networking quirks, and Kubernetes.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how awesome Javascript is.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: just holler.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: No, I don't have any strong feelings about nouns, I'm not Antinouns either.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do much on public Github because I don't get paid for it.
